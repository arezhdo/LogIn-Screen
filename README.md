Parental Log In or Sign Up screen using Parse - AppleDoc


Hello! This is a log in/sign up screen for parental section of my app. Using Swift 2.0 and Parse to store usernames, emails and passwords for a secure entry.

The three files are connected to three separate Storyboard View Controllers. There's buttons that take the user from one screen to the other, connected through the navigation exitToSegue as well as other buttons in the screen only connected through storyboard segues.
